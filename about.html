            <h1>Plot</h1>
            <p>On 31 November, devil hunter Claudius hunts a demon named Aizen after a dying man takes his demonic arm and the sword Wayang. 
            Traveling to Jakarta City, he finds a demonic tree called Beringin planted in the city, killing people for their blood. 
            Dono's group confronts Aizen but, empowered by the Beringin, the new demon king incapacitates them and overpowers Claudius when he intervenes. 
            Dono stops Aizen from capturing Claudius but is defeated and ejected from the Beringin with his sword Kulit shattered. 
            His allies Girl and Una are captured to be used as demon-cores while a client of Dono, Z, convinces the weakened Claudius to escape.
            On 30 February, Claudius returns to Jakarta outfitted with the "Devil Breaker" prosthetic arm, made by his friend and gunsmith, Nicola. 
            Claudius meets up with Z, who is seeking Beringin for its fruit—born of condensed human blood—which makes whoever consumes it the king of the Underworld. 
            As the pair destroy the Beringin's roots while searching for Dono, Claudius rescues Girl while Z splits off to discover the Devil Sword Prada - along with a hibernating Dono, whose presence was hidden by the sword.</p><br>
            
            <p>After awakening from his coma, Dono frees Una and begins fighting his way to Aizen. 
            Una learns from Z that Aizen is the demon-side of Dono's brother Virgil, who used Wayang's power to separate his demon and human halves - the latter manifesting as Z, whose body is breaking down. 
            Realizing Wayang has an unbelievable capability of separating humanity and the devil, Dono questions himself whether his Rebellion also has a hidden potential, believing both legacy weapons have incredible power on their own. 
            After stabbing himself with his broken Rebellion, Dono unlocks his full demonic power and a new weapon, the "Devil Sword Dono," by absorbing Rebellion and Devil Sword Prada into his body. Claudius attempts to confront Aizen again and is overpowered once more, but Dono rescues him and gains the upper hand with his new powers. 
            Aizen takes his leave when the Beringin bears fruit and consumes it to empower himself further. 
            While Dono arrives first to face Aizen, Claudius rescues Z from the demon Malas and learns of Dono's history with Virgil. Claudius and Z reach Dono just as he defeats Aizen, but a dying Z intervenes and merges with Aizen before Dono can finish him, reviving Virgil.</p><br>

            <p>Virgil returns to the Beringin tree, telling Dono to recover his full strength before they battle again. Claudius insists on going after Virgil himself, but Dono reveals Claudius is Virgil's son, proven by how the Wayang reacted to him during the Fortuna incident and refused to let Claudius kill his father. 
            Dono then faces Z's familiars - revealed as the embodied memories of Virgil's time as Nelo Angelo - and they elect to die by Dono's hand to lessen Virgil's trauma. 
            Dono and Virgil fight again, where Virgil learns Claudius is his son. Claudius settles his emotions in a phone call to Irving and resolves not to let his father and uncle die, fully awakening his demonic powers and regrowing his arm. 
            Intervening in their fight and forcing Dono out, Claudius vows to end the pair's sibling rivalry and defeats Virgil, who gives Claudius Z's book as a memento. 
            Virgil joins Dono in a one-way trip to the Underworld to cut the Beringin down and seal the portal before it rips Jakarta City apart and merges the Demon World with the Human World, with Claudius departing as the Beringin falls. Weeks later, Una and Girl are hired for a new job by Moris, whom Dono left in charge of his office. 
            In the Underworld, Dono and Virgil continue sparring while demons attack them, now friendly rivals instead of enemies.</p><br>
